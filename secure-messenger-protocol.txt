INTERNET DRAFT         Secure Messenger Protocol                        


1  Introduction

   The Secure Messenger Protocol specifies a file-format to allow
   communication between any Messenger Application or E-Mail Program
   that implements this protocol. The file-format is text-based and
   contains some meta-information as well as encrypted data, which can
   be via E-Mail as attachment or as plain text. The protocol takes care
   of public-key-exchange between recipients, private-key-distribution
   between different Apps and Programs of the user himself as well as a
   simple format to place attachments like images or documents.

1.1  Typical content

      1. E-Mail Subject is always: "Secure Messenger Protocol Message"

      2. Attachment named: public-key-1 (optional)

         2.1 public-key is a "PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK"

      3. Attachment named: encryped-and-signed-data, which contains:

         3.1 group name

         3.2 list of recipients
